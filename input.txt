 #This file will test features and parsing edge cases forthe CS-460 project 2 python interpreter.
# Leave the formatting exactly as it is so that it can test properly.
# This definitely doesn't cover every possible case, but it covers the majority of them.
#Some print commands are commented out, as they will produce errors.
#Try uncommenting them and making sure your program produces errors.

# Note that for checking errors I use if statements and bool/rel expressions. If something reports an error when you think it shouldn't,
# it's possible it was your handling of if statements or bool/rel expressions that actually caused the error.

   #print "Unexpected indentation. This should be an error!"
